# Resilience2Relief AI - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup ✅
- [x] Create missing directories structure (data/documents, templates, app)
- [x] Implement document_loader.py with multi-format support
- [x] Create utils.py with helper functions
- [x] Add sample disaster recovery documents
- [x] Create project output templates
- [x] Set up proper project structure
=======
## Phase 2: Enhanced Backend
- [ ] Complete main.py with comprehensive endpoints
- [ ] Refactor RAG chains for better modularity
- [ ] Add structured project generation with sectors
- [ ] Implement search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Add proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Create Pydantic models for API

## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, API)
- [ ] Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Final API testing with curl commands
- [ ] Commit and push changes to repository

## Current Status: Starting Phase 1
