## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, API)
- [ ] Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Final API testing with curl commands
- [x] Commit and push changes to repository
